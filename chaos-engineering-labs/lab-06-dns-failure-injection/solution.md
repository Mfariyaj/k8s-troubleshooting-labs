## Solution: lab-06-dns-failure-injection

### Root Cause
DNS resolution fails: does retry logic work?

### Fix
1. Identify the misconfiguration from the error message
2. Fix the broken config file (check for typos, wrong values, missing fields)
3. Restart/re-apply the configuration
4. Verify the error is resolved

### Key Takeaway
Always read error messages carefully — they usually point directly to the problem.
Check configuration syntax, paths, and connectivity before diving deeper.
